=head1 NAME

jcut - cut out selected portions of each JSON object in a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  jsonpath -o json_path_1 [-o json_path_2 ...] < input.json

  jcut -o json_path_1 --input eg/sample.json

  jcut -o json_path_1 --input eg/sample.json --output new.json

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jsonpath(1) cuts out selected portions of each JSON record and writes
them to standard output or a named file.  Fields are selected using
JSON::Path expressions, which are a Perl-centric variant of JSONPath.

Multiple fields may be specified with additional -o flags.

JSON::Path expressions make terrible field names, so output fields are
named col#, beginning with col0.  jmap(1) may be used to give each
output field a more useful name.

jsonpath(1) inherits its --input, --output and --verbose flags from
L<App::PipeFilter::Role::Flags::Standard>.
See that module for more detailed documentation.

jsonpath(1) inherits its -o flag from L<App::PipeFilter::JsonPath>.
See that module for more detailed documentation.
