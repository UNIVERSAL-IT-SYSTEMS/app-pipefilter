=head1 NAME

jmap - map input JSON fields to output JSON fields by renaming them

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Convert input fields "one" and "two" to uppercase versions on output:

  jmap -i one -o ONE -i two -o TWO < input.json

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jmap(1) reads files sequentially, altering some or all of their field
names before writing them to standard output or a named file.  It
behaves like jcat(1) but renames fields in the process.

jmap(1) inherits its --input, --output and --verbose flags from
L<App::PipeFilter::Role::Flags::Standard>.
See that module for more detailed documentation.

jmap(1) inherits its -i and -o flags from L<App::PipeFilter::JsonMap>.
See that module for more detailed documentation.
